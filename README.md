<H3>What</H3>
<p>A presentation Webpage made for CSE3403 about HTML5. The webpage was made by myself based on a free framework. Information in detail can be found in Licence.txt

PS: If you are going to load the page on your hard-drive, use FireFox, since there's some sort of security restriction in place in Chrome for using geolocation from a file:///URI.</p>
